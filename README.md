# Knapsack
this is an implemenation of local search algorithms (hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm) to solve the knapsack problem.
the generate_date.py file creates a random data in the my-file.txt file.
you can run the code by  python knapsack.py --algorithm ga --file my-file.txt
if u want to run with other algorithms just change the ga to hc or sa.
